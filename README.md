# Luvotels - Full-stack hiring test - Adriano

### Specs used to evaluate this test

1. Didn't use database, as the app uses an api it looked to me that including an database would be unnecessary;
2. ActiveResource for the API interaction;
3. MemoryStore for caching api;
4. Slim;
5. Rspec for testing;

All that said, had to make some workaround (create specific methods on models) to cope with a problem in ActiveResource associations as they weren't working as expected.

Forgot to mention that the app is online on Heroku.
